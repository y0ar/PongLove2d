# PongLove2d

This small project aims at creating the Pong game from a single file.

Just run it using LÖVE and you're good to go.

If you don't know how, check out this [LÖVE wiki page](https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started) for instructions.

# Features

- Player vs Computer. The Computer paddle only goes up and down for now.
- You can redirect the ball by moving up or down the moment your paddle hits it.
